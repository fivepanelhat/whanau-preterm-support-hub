## Vision

Every whÄnau in Aotearoa who experiences preterm twin birth has immediate, equitable, culturally safe access to:

- Trusted information and resources (MÄori, Pacific, and clinical pathways)
- Peer connection and support
- Clear funding and service navigation (WINZ, DHBs, iwi providers)
- Trauma-informed tools that honour whakapapa, rangatiratanga, and manaakitanga

The platform is built in partnership with whÄnau, iwi (including MuaÅ«poko), health professionals, and community organisations. Technology serves people  never the other way around.

## Key Principles

- **Te Tiriti o Waitangi**  Rangatiratanga, kaitiakitanga, manaakitanga, kotahitanga
- **Te Mana Raraunga**  MÄori data sovereignty as first-class architecture
- **No PHI by default**  Platform stores only general information and consented resources. Any personal health data remains under whÄnau control or with their chosen providers.
- **Trauma-informed & culturally safe** by design
- **Accessibility first**  WCAG 2.2 AA minimum, mobile-first, low-bandwidth friendly
- **Open source & sovereign**  Apache 2.0 licence with strong cultural and health disclaimers
- **Agentic development with HITL**  Orchestrated by Aether v0.6.2+ (sovereign multi-agent system) with mandatory human approval gates for all releases and sensitive decisions

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI primitives
- **Orchestration & Safety**: Aether v0.6.2 sovereign agentic system (ReAct + skills + release-preflight guardrails)
- **Release Safety**: Custom `hub_release_preflight.py` (adapted from Aether) + GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: Vercel (primary) + self-host option (Docker)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright (E2E)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with mandatory preflight job

## Getting Started (Local Development)

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/fivepanelhat/whanau-preterm-support-hub.git
cd whanau-preterm-support-hub

# 2. Install
npm install

# 3. Run dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

### Run Release Preflight (before any tag/push)

```bash
python scripts/hub_release_preflight.py --version 0.1.0
```

The script enforces visibility checks, sensitive file scanning, monotonic versioning, clean tree, and test passage.

## Contribution Guidelines

We warmly welcome contributions from:

- WhÄnau with lived experience of preterm twin birth
- MÄori and Pacific health navigators, midwives, and clinicians
- Iwi and community organisations
- Developers who respect Te Tiriti and data sovereignty
- Cultural reviewers and accessibility specialists

**Before contributing code or content**:
1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
2. For any content touching MÄori or Pacific knowledge, partner with cultural reviewers early.
3. All medical/clinical information must include clear disclaimers and be evidence-based.
4. Run `npm run typecheck && npm test` before opening a PR.
5. For releases, the preflight script **must** pass and a human must confirm.

We use conventional commits and squash-merge. Large features are discussed via GitHub Discussions or Issues first.

## Security & Privacy

- **No storage of Protected Health Information (PHI)** without explicit, revocable, granular consent and clear purpose limitation.
- All releases are gated by the release-preflight script (sensitive file detection, clean tree, monotonic versioning).
- Strong defaults for input sanitisation, CSP headers, and rate limiting.
- See `SECURITY.md` for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Health & Medical Disclaimer

**This platform is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.**

Always seek the advice of your midwife, doctor, or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or pregnancy. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on this platform.

If you are in crisis or experiencing distress, please contact:
- Your midwife or lead maternity carer immediately
- Healthline: 0800 611 116
- In emergency: 111
